# runit-services

This repository contains a few services that can be used on runit-based Linux distributions, as the packages don't come with a runit service by default.

Instructions for each one can be found in the subfolders, but note they are made with Artix Linux in mind. Other distributions like Void are similar but must be adapted slightly.
